#### 3. **Core Concepts:**

- **Neural Networks:**
  - **Definition:** A neural network is a series of algorithms that attempts to recognize underlying relationships in a set of data through a process that mimics the way the human brain operates.
  - **Structure:** Composed of layers, including an input layer, hidden layers, and an output layer. Each layer consists of nodes (neurons) that process inputs and pass on outputs to the next layer.

- **Activation Functions:**
  - **Purpose:** Introduce non-linearity into the network, allowing it to learn complex patterns.
  - **Examples:** Sigmoid, ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit), and Tanh.

- **Deep Learning:**
  - **Definition:** A subset of machine learning involving neural networks with many layers (deep networks) that can learn from large amounts of data.
  - **Importance:** Enables the modeling of complex patterns and relationships within data, essential for tasks like image and speech recognition.

- **Training a Neural Network:**
  - **Process:** Involves feeding data into the network, adjusting weights through backpropagation, and minimizing error using optimization techniques such as gradient descent.

#### 4. **Practical Application:**

- **Example in Quantum Machine Learning:**
  - Quantum computers can potentially enhance neural network training by solving optimization problems faster than classical computers. For instance, using quantum annealing to optimize weight configurations in a neural network.

- **Code Snippet:**
  ```python
  import tensorflow as tf
  from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
  from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense

  # Define a simple neural network
  model = Sequential([
      Dense(32, activation='relu', input_shape=(784,)),
      Dense(10, activation='softmax')
  ])

  # Compile the model
  model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

  # Summary of the model
  model.summary()
  ```
