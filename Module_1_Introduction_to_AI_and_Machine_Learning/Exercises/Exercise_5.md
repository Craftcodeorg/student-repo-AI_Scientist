## Exercise 5: Explore Unsupervised Clustering Techniques

### Exercise Requirements

#### 1. Problem Statement

In this exercise, you will apply unsupervised clustering techniques to explore ethical implications in AI systems, specifically focusing on bias detection in healthcare datasets. As an aspiring AI researcher, you will investigate how clustering can help identify potential biases in patient data, which is crucial for developing fair and transparent AI models. 

**Scenario**: You are tasked with analyzing a dataset containing patient health records. Your goal is to use unsupervised clustering to identify patterns that may indicate bias in the data, such as disparities in treatment outcomes based on demographic attributes. This analysis will help you understand the ethical considerations in AI healthcare applications and propose strategies to mitigate bias.

**Tasks**:
- Load a provided healthcare dataset.
- Apply a clustering algorithm (e.g., K-Means) to group similar patient records.
- Analyze the clusters to identify any patterns that suggest bias.
- Discuss your findings and propose methods to address identified biases.

#### 2. Fill-in-the-Blank Starter Code

Below is the starter code with blanks for you to fill in. This code will guide you through loading the dataset, applying a clustering algorithm, and analyzing the results.

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load the healthcare dataset
data = pd.read_csv('healthcare_data.csv')

# Select features for clustering
features = data[['age', 'treatment_outcome', 'ethnicity']]

# Initialize KMeans with a specified number of clusters
kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=______)

# Fit the model to the data
kmeans.fit(______)

# Assign cluster labels to each record
data['cluster'] = kmeans.predict(______)

# Plot the clusters to visualize potential biases
plt.scatter(data['age'], data['treatment_outcome'], c=data['cluster'])
plt.xlabel('Age')
plt.ylabel('Treatment Outcome')
plt.title('Clustering of Patient Records')
plt.show()

# Analyze clusters for bias patterns
# (Add your analysis here)
```

#### 3. Hints

- **Choosing the Number of Clusters**: Consider starting with a small number of clusters (e.g., 3-5) and adjust based on initial results. Think about what different clusters might represent in terms of patient demographics.
  
- **Feature Selection**: Ensure that the features selected for clustering are relevant to identifying bias (e.g., age, treatment outcomes, ethnicity). You may need to preprocess or normalize data for better clustering results.

- **Interpreting Clusters**: Look at the distribution of demographic attributes within each cluster. Are certain groups overrepresented or underrepresented? This could indicate bias.

#### 4. Expected Outcome

By completing this exercise, you should be able to:
- Correctly fill in the blanks in the starter code.
- Use unsupervised clustering to detect patterns that may indicate bias in healthcare data.
- Provide a well-reasoned analysis of your findings, including potential ethical implications.
- Suggest strategies to mitigate identified biases, demonstrating a deep understanding of ethical AI development.

### Integration

This exercise is designed to be integrated into a learning platform with clear headings and sections for easy navigation. Ensure that the necessary dataset (`healthcare_data.csv`) is available for download. Use markdown formatting for clarity, and include any additional resources or references that may aid in understanding the exercise context.

This exercise aligns with your career goals and interests by applying unsupervised learning techniques to real-world scenarios in AI ethics, particularly in healthcareâ€”a field of significant societal impact.
