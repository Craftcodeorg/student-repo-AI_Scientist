### Exercise 5: Design an AI System for Artistic Creation

#### Problem Statement

As a leading AI researcher with a deep interest in both AI-driven art and space exploration, you are tasked with designing an AI system that combines these two domains. Your goal is to create a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) that generates artistic representations inspired by astronomical data, such as images of galaxies, nebulae, and other celestial phenomena. This system should not only produce visually appealing art but also highlight the potential of AI in transforming space data into creative outputs.

Your task is to:

1. Implement a GAN that takes astronomical data as input and generates artistic images.
2. Ensure the system can handle large datasets efficiently, reflecting the vastness of space data.
3. Address ethical considerations regarding the originality of AI-generated art.

#### Fill-in-the-Blank Starter Code

Below is the starter code for your GAN implementation. Fill in the blanks to complete the functionality:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense, LeakyReLU, Reshape, Flatten
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential

# Define the generator model
def build_generator(input_dim):
    model = Sequential()
    model.add(Dense(256, input_dim=input_dim))
    model.add(LeakyReLU(alpha=0.2))
    model.add(Dense(512))
    model.add(LeakyReLU(alpha=0.2))
    model.add(Dense(1024))
    model.add(LeakyReLU(alpha=0.2))
    model.add(Dense(784, activation='tanh'))
    model.add(Reshape((28, 28)))
    return model

# Define the discriminator model
def build_discriminator(input_shape):
    model = Sequential()
    model.add(Flatten(input_shape=input_shape))
    model.add(Dense(512))
    model.add(LeakyReLU(alpha=0.2))
    model.add(Dense(256))
    model.add(LeakyReLU(alpha=0.2))
    model.add(Dense(1, activation='sigmoid'))
    return model

# Compile the GAN
def compile_gan(generator, discriminator):
    discriminator.compile(loss='binary_crossentropy', optimizer='adam', metrics=['accuracy'])
    discriminator.trainable = False
    gan_input = tf.keras.Input(shape=(100,))
    x = generator(gan_input)
    gan_output = discriminator(x)
    gan = tf.keras.Model(gan_input, gan_output)
    gan.compile(loss='binary_crossentropy', optimizer='adam')
    return gan

# Initialize models
generator = build_generator(input_dim=100)
discriminator = build_discriminator(input_shape=(28, 28))

# Compile GAN
gan = compile_gan(generator, discriminator)

# Placeholder for training function
def train_gan(gan, generator, discriminator, epochs, batch_size, data):
    # Implement training loop here
    for epoch in range(epochs):
        # Training code here
        pass

# Example usage with astronomical data
# Assume `astronomical_data` is preprocessed and available
train_gan(gan, generator, discriminator, epochs=10000, batch_size=64, data=astronomical_data)
```

#### Hints

1. **Data Handling**: Consider using astronomical datasets from public sources like NASA's archives. Preprocess these images to a consistent size and format suitable for your GAN.
   
2. **Model Architecture**: Ensure your generator and discriminator are balanced in complexity to avoid overfitting or underfitting.

3. **Ethical Considerations**: Reflect on the originality of your AI-generated art. How might you credit the source data or ensure transparency in your creative process?

4. **Performance Optimization**: Utilize high-performance computing resources to manage large datasets effectively.

#### Expected Outcome

Upon completing this exercise, you should have a fully functional GAN capable of generating artistic images inspired by astronomical data. The implementation should demonstrate best practices in AI development, including:

- Efficient data handling and preprocessing.
- Balanced and well-commented GAN architecture.
- Ethical consideration of AI-generated content.
- Robust error handling and documentation.

This exercise will reinforce your understanding of applying AI in creative domains while considering ethical implications, aligning with your career goals in Academic Research and Development.
