## Exercise 4: Use AI to Model Climate Change Scenarios

### Problem Statement:
As an aspiring AI researcher with a focus on neural network optimization and predictive analytics, your task is to develop a model that predicts future climate scenarios based on historical weather data. This exercise will involve using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to forecast temperature trends, leveraging your expertise in Python and TensorFlow. The goal is to create a model that can be used to anticipate climate patterns, which is crucial for disaster preparedness and resource allocation.

### Fill-in-the-Blank Starter Code:
Below is the starter code for implementing an LSTM model. Fill in the blanks to complete the functionality.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import LSTM, Dense
import numpy as np

# Assume historical data is preprocessed and available as numpy arrays
# 'historical_data' is a 2D array where each row is a sequence of temperature values
# 'target_data' is a 1D array of target temperature values for each sequence

# Define model architecture
model = Sequential()
model.add(LSTM(50, return_sequences=True, input_shape=(historical_data.shape[1], 1)))
model.add(LSTM(50))
model.add(Dense(1))

# Compile the model with appropriate optimizer and loss function
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mean_squared_error')

# Train the model on historical data
model.fit(historical_data, target_data, epochs=100, batch_size=32)

# Predict future temperature trends
future_predictions = model.predict(_______)

# Print predictions for analysis
print("Predicted future temperatures:", future_predictions)
```

### Hints:
1. **Data Preparation**: Ensure that your input data (`historical_data`) is reshaped correctly to fit the LSTM input requirements. Each sequence should be reshaped to have dimensions `(number_of_sequences, sequence_length, 1)`.

2. **Model Compilation**: The optimizer 'adam' and loss function 'mean_squared_error' are commonly used in regression tasks like temperature prediction. Make sure these are correctly implemented.

3. **Prediction Input**: When predicting future trends, ensure the input to `model.predict()` is in the correct format and matches the input shape defined during model creation.

### Expected Outcome:
By completing this exercise, you should be able to fill in the blanks to successfully build and train an LSTM model for climate prediction. Your solution should demonstrate an understanding of AI-driven solutions for climate change mitigation. The final code should include error handling and comments explaining the reasoning behind each step, adhering to best practices in AI model development.

### Integration:
- Ensure this exercise is integrated into your learning platform with markdown formatting for clarity.
- Include links to any necessary datasets or resources needed to complete the exercise.
- Encourage collaboration with peers or mentors to discuss potential improvements or alternative approaches to the problem.

By engaging with this exercise, you will enhance your skills in applying AI technologies to real-world environmental challenges, aligning with your career goals of contributing to innovative machine learning solutions.
