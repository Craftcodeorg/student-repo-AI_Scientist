### Exercise 1: Analyze Ethical Dilemmas in AI Case Studies

#### Problem Statement

As an AI researcher specializing in Quantum Machine Learning, you are tasked with analyzing ethical dilemmas in AI applications. Consider a scenario where a Quantum Machine Learning model is used in healthcare to predict patient outcomes based on genetic data. This model raises several ethical concerns regarding bias, privacy, and accountability.

Your task is to:
1. Identify and analyze at least three ethical dilemmas that could arise from using this Quantum Machine Learning model.
2. Propose solutions or strategies to mitigate these ethical issues, drawing from the ethical principles and frameworks discussed in Lecture 1.

#### Fill-in-the-Blank Starter Code

```python
# Starter code for analyzing ethical implications in Quantum Machine Learning

def analyze_ethics(ethical_dilemmas):
    """
    Analyze the given ethical dilemmas and propose solutions.
    
    Parameters:
    ethical_dilemmas (list): A list of identified ethical dilemmas.
    
    Returns:
    dict: A dictionary with dilemmas as keys and proposed solutions as values.
    """
    solutions = {}
    for dilemma in ethical_dilemmas:
        if dilemma == "bias":
            # Propose a solution for bias in the model
            solutions[dilemma] = "Implement ________ to ensure fairness in predictions."
        elif dilemma == "privacy":
            # Propose a solution for privacy concerns
            solutions[dilemma] = "Use ________ techniques to protect patient data."
        elif dilemma == "accountability":
            # Propose a solution for accountability issues
            solutions[dilemma] = "Establish clear ________ for AI decisions."
        else:
            solutions[dilemma] = "No solution proposed."
    return solutions

# Example ethical dilemmas identified in the case study
ethical_dilemmas = ["bias", "privacy", "accountability"]

# Analyze the dilemmas and print proposed solutions
print(analyze_ethics(ethical_dilemmas))
```

#### Hints

1. **Bias**: Consider how biases can be introduced through training data and how they can be mitigated using techniques like balanced datasets or fairness constraints.
   
2. **Privacy**: Think about data anonymization and encryption methods that can protect sensitive genetic information while still allowing for accurate predictions.

3. **Accountability**: Reflect on the importance of having clear documentation and human oversight mechanisms that hold developers and operators accountable for AI outcomes.

#### Expected Outcome

Upon completing this exercise, you should be able to:
- Clearly identify and articulate the ethical challenges associated with using Quantum Machine Learning in sensitive fields like healthcare.
- Propose practical solutions that align with ethical principles such as fairness, transparency, and accountability.
- Demonstrate a comprehensive understanding of how these ethical considerations apply to real-world scenarios, particularly in Academic Research and Development.

The final solution should be well-documented, with comments explaining the rationale behind each proposed solution. It should also incorporate error handling where applicable, ensuring robust and reliable code implementation.
