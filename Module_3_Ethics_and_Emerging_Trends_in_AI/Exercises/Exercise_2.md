## Module Title: Ethics and Emerging Trends in AI

### Exercise 2: Simulate an Autonomous Vehicle's Response to Dynamic Environments

---

#### Problem Statement:

In this exercise, you will simulate an autonomous vehicle's response to dynamic environments, integrating AI techniques discussed in the lecture. Your task is to develop a Python script that processes sensor data and makes real-time decisions for an autonomous vehicle navigating through a complex traffic scenario. Consider safety concerns and ethical implications, such as decision-making in critical situations and bias in AI systems.

Scenario: An autonomous vehicle is driving through a busy urban area with pedestrians, cyclists, and other vehicles. It must decide when to stop, slow down, or change lanes based on sensor data inputs. Your simulation should reflect these dynamic elements and ensure safe navigation while considering ethical decision-making.

#### Fill-in-the-Blank Starter Code:

Below is the starter code for your simulation. Fill in the blanks to complete the functionality.

```python
import numpy as np

# Function to simulate processing of sensor data
def process_sensor_data(sensor_data):
    # Simulate processing sensor data with a neural network model
    processed_data = np.mean(sensor_data)  # Simplified processing
    return processed_data

# Function to make decisions based on processed data
def make_decision(processed_data):
    # Implement decision-making logic based on processed sensor data
    if processed_data > _______:  # Threshold for stopping
        decision = "Stop"
    elif processed_data > _______:  # Threshold for slowing down
        decision = "Slow Down"
    else:
        decision = "Continue"
    return decision

# Example sensor data representing a dynamic environment
sensor_data = [0.6, 0.7, 0.75, 0.65]

# Process the sensor data
processed_data = process_sensor_data(sensor_data)

# Make a decision based on the processed data
decision = make_decision(processed_data)

print(f"Decision: {decision}")
```

#### Hints:

1. **Threshold Values**: Consider what sensor data values might represent a safe distance for stopping or slowing down in a real-world scenario. Use these insights to set your thresholds.

2. **Decision Logic**: Think about how an autonomous vehicle would prioritize safety in various situations. How does it decide when to stop versus when to slow down?

3. **Ethical Considerations**: Reflect on how biases in sensor data interpretation could affect decision-making. How can you ensure fairness in the decisions your simulation makes?

---

#### Expected Outcome:

By completing this exercise, you should be able to:

- Correctly fill in the blanks to implement a basic decision-making system for an autonomous vehicle.
- Demonstrate an understanding of how AI processes sensor data and makes real-time decisions.
- Apply ethical considerations in AI decision-making processes, ensuring fairness and safety.
- Produce a well-commented Python script that adheres to best practices, including error handling and clear explanations of each step.

Your final solution should simulate the vehicle's response accurately and reflect the ethical implications discussed in the lecture.
