  ```python
  import tensorflow as tf
  from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
  from tensorflow.keras.layers import LSTM, Dense

  # Define model
  model = Sequential()
  model.add(LSTM(50, return_sequences=True, input_shape=(10, 1)))
  model.add(LSTM(50))
  model.add(Dense(1))

  # Compile model
  model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mean_squared_error')
  ```
