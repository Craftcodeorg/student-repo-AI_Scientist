**Example: Quantum Portfolio Optimization**
- **Scenario:** A financial institution uses QML to optimize its investment portfolio, balancing risk and return more effectively than traditional methods.
- **Code Snippet:**
  ```python
  from qiskit import QuantumCircuit
  from qiskit_machine_learning.algorithms import QSVM

  # Initialize a simple quantum circuit
  qc = QuantumCircuit(2)
  qc.h(0)  # Apply Hadamard gate
  qc.cx(0, 1)  # Apply CNOT gate

  # Placeholder for QSVM implementation
  qsvm = QSVM(feature_map=qc)
  # Assume 'data' is your financial dataset
  qsvm.fit(data['train'], data['labels'])
  predictions = qsvm.predict(data['test'])
  ```

**Real-World Example:**
- **D-Wave's Quantum Annealer:** Used by financial firms for solving complex optimization problems, such as asset allocation and pricing derivatives.
