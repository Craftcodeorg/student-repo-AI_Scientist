#### 4. Practical Application:

- **Real-World Example**: Tesla's Autopilot system uses a combination of neural networks to interpret data from its sensors, allowing for semi-autonomous driving. This showcases the practical application of AI in enhancing vehicle safety and efficiency.
  
- **Code Snippet Example**:
  ```python
  # Simple Python snippet to simulate sensor data processing
  import numpy as np

  def process_sensor_data(sensor_data):
      # Simulate processing sensor data with a neural network model
      processed_data = np.mean(sensor_data)  # Simplified processing
      return processed_data

  sensor_data = [0.8, 0.9, 0.85, 0.87]
  result = process_sensor_data(sensor_data)
  print(f"Processed Sensor Data: {result}")
  ```

This snippet illustrates how sensor data might be processed in a simplified manner to inform decision-making in an autonomous vehicle.
