## 4. Practical Application:

### Example 1: GANs in Art
Consider a GAN that generates paintings by analyzing thousands of artworks. The following Python snippet illustrates a simple GAN setup:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense, LeakyReLU

# Generator model
def build_generator():
    model = tf.keras.Sequential()
    model.add(Dense(128, input_dim=100))
    model.add(LeakyReLU(alpha=0.01))
    model.add(Dense(784, activation='tanh'))
    return model

generator = build_generator()
```

### Example 2: AI in Space Exploration
NASA's Mars Rover uses AI for autonomous navigation. By employing deep learning algorithms, it can adjust its path based on terrain analysis without human intervention.
