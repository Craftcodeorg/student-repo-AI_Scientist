### Assignment: Ethical AI Framework Implementation in Healthcare Diagnostics

**Module Title:** Ethics and Emerging Trends in AI  
**Assignment Title:** Develop an Ethical Framework for AI Deployment in Healthcare Diagnostics

---

### Problem Statement

In the realm of healthcare diagnostics, the deployment of AI models requires careful consideration of ethical principles to ensure fairness, transparency, and accountability. Your task is to create a Python function that evaluates the fairness of an AI model used for predicting patient diagnoses. The function should assess potential biases in the model's predictions by comparing the accuracy across different demographic groups.

**Objective:** Implement a fairness check function that analyzes prediction accuracy for different demographic groups and identifies any significant disparities.

### Starter Code

Below is the starter code that sets up a basic framework for evaluating model fairness. Your task is to expand upon this code to complete the assignment requirements.

```python
# Starter code for evaluating fairness in AI healthcare diagnostics

from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

def evaluate_fairness(y_true, y_pred, demographics):
    """
    Evaluates the fairness of model predictions across different demographic groups.
    
    Parameters:
    - y_true: List of true diagnosis labels
    - y_pred: List of predicted diagnosis labels
    - demographics: List of demographic identifiers corresponding to each prediction
    
    Returns:
    - fairness_report: Dictionary with accuracy scores for each demographic group
    """
    
    # Initialize a dictionary to store accuracy scores for each demographic group
    fairness_report = {}
    
    # Step 1: Calculate overall accuracy
    overall_accuracy = accuracy_score(y_true, y_pred)
    
    # Step 2: Calculate accuracy for each demographic group
    for group in set(demographics):
        group_indices = [i for i, x in enumerate(demographics) if x == group]
        group_y_true = [y_true[i] for i in group_indices]
        group_y_pred = [y_pred[i] for i in group_indices]
        
        # Calculate and store the accuracy for this group
        group_accuracy = accuracy_score(group_y_true, group_y_pred)
        fairness_report[group] = group_accuracy
    
    # Return the fairness report
    return overall_accuracy, fairness_report

# Example usage
y_true = [1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0]
y_pred = [1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1]
demographics = ['Group A', 'Group B', 'Group A', 'Group B', 'Group A', 'Group B']

overall_acc, fairness_report = evaluate_fairness(y_true, y_pred, demographics)
print(f"Overall Accuracy: {overall_acc}")
print("Fairness Report:", fairness_report)
```

### Detailed Instructions

1. **Step 1: Modify the Function**
   - Enhance the `evaluate_fairness` function to not only return overall and group-specific accuracies but also identify any groups where the accuracy deviates from the overall accuracy by more than a specified threshold (e.g., 5%).

2. **Step 2: Improve Output Feedback**
   - Adjust the output to provide detailed feedback on which demographic groups have significant disparities. Include suggestions for addressing these disparities.

3. **Step 3: Documentation and Code Quality**
   - Ensure your code is well-documented with comments explaining each step. Follow best practices for clean and readable code.

4. **Step 4: Testing and Validation**
   - Test your function with various datasets to ensure it accurately identifies biases. Document your test cases and results.

### Criteria for Success and Evaluation

**Success Criteria:**

- The function accurately calculates overall and group-specific accuracies.
- The function identifies demographic groups with significant accuracy disparities.
- The code is clean, well-documented, and follows best practices.
- The output provides clear and actionable insights into model fairness.

**Evaluation Rubric:**

| Criteria                      | Excellent | Good     | Needs Improvement |
|-------------------------------|-----------|----------|-------------------|
| Accuracy Calculation          | Correctly calculates all accuracies | Minor errors in calculation | Incorrect or missing calculations |
| Bias Identification           | Accurately identifies all biases | Misses some biases | Fails to identify biases |
| Code Quality                  | Clean, well-documented code | Minor issues in documentation | Poorly documented or messy code |
| Output Clarity                | Clear and insightful feedback | Feedback lacks detail | Feedback is unclear or unhelpful |

This assignment aims to reinforce your understanding of ethical AI practices in healthcare diagnostics while building practical coding skills applicable to real-world scenarios in Academic Research and Development.
