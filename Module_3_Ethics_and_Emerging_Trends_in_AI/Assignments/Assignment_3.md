### Assignment: Quantum Machine Learning for Financial Portfolio Optimization

---

#### Problem Statement:

In this assignment, you will apply Quantum Machine Learning (QML) concepts to optimize a financial portfolio. The task is to create a quantum-enhanced algorithm that selects an optimal subset of assets from a given dataset, maximizing returns while minimizing risk. This exercise will help you understand how QML can be applied in real-world financial systems, a crucial skill in Academic Research and Development.

#### Starter Code:

Below is the starter code that sets up the environment for implementing a Quantum Support Vector Machine (QSVM) to optimize a financial portfolio. You will expand upon this code to complete the task.

```python
from qiskit import Aer, QuantumCircuit
from qiskit_machine_learning.algorithms import QSVM
from qiskit_machine_learning.datasets import ad_hoc_data

# Load a sample financial dataset
# For simplicity, we'll use an ad-hoc dataset provided by Qiskit
feature_dim = 2
train_features, train_labels, test_features, test_labels = ad_hoc_data(
    training_size=20, test_size=10, n=feature_dim, gap=0.3
)

# Initialize a simple quantum circuit for feature mapping
qc = QuantumCircuit(feature_dim)
qc.h(range(feature_dim))  # Apply Hadamard gates

# Initialize QSVM with the quantum feature map
qsvm = QSVM(feature_map=qc)

# Placeholder for fitting the model
def optimize_portfolio(train_features, train_labels):
    # Step 1: Fit the QSVM model to the training data
    qsvm.fit(train_features, train_labels)
    
    # Step 2: Predict the optimal asset allocation on test data
    predictions = qsvm.predict(test_features)
    
    # Return predictions for further analysis
    return predictions

# Test the function with the sample dataset
predictions = optimize_portfolio(train_features, train_labels)
print(f"Predicted Optimal Portfolio Allocation: {predictions}")
```

#### Detailed Instructions:

**Step 1: Implement the QSVM Model**

- Modify the `optimize_portfolio` function to include error handling for data input.
- Ensure that the model training (`qsvm.fit`) and prediction (`qsvm.predict`) processes are correctly implemented with appropriate validation checks.

**Step 2: Analyze and Interpret Results**

- Enhance the output of `optimize_portfolio` to not only return predictions but also provide a detailed report of predicted asset allocations.
- Include a risk assessment metric that evaluates the predicted portfolio's variance compared to historical data.

**Step 3: Ethical Considerations**

- Add comments discussing the ethical implications of using QML in financial markets, focusing on transparency and fairness.

#### Criteria for Success and Evaluation:

**Success Criteria:**

- The function correctly implements a QSVM model to optimize asset allocation.
- The code is robust, includes error handling, and is well-documented.
- The output is comprehensive, providing clear insights into the predicted portfolio and associated risks.
- Ethical considerations are thoughtfully discussed in code comments.

**Evaluation Rubric:**

- **Accuracy (40%)**: The model accurately predicts optimal asset allocations and evaluates risks.
- **Code Quality (30%)**: The code is clean, well-organized, and follows best practices.
- **Output Clarity (20%)**: The results are presented in a user-friendly manner with detailed insights.
- **Ethical Reflection (10%)**: The assignment includes a thoughtful discussion on ethical implications.

This assignment simulates a realistic task in Academic Research and Development, reinforcing your understanding of QML applications in financial markets while enhancing your practical coding skills.
