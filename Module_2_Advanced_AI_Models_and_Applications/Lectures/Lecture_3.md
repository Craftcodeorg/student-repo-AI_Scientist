#### 4. Practical Application:

- **Example: Self-Driving Cars**:
  - Self-driving cars use RL to learn optimal driving strategies by simulating millions of driving scenarios. This helps them adapt to new environments and improve over time.
  
- **Code Snippet**:
  ```python
  import gym
  import numpy as np

  env = gym.make('CartPole-v1')
  observation = env.reset()

  for _ in range(1000):
      env.render()
      action = env.action_space.sample()  # Random action
      observation, reward, done, info = env.step(action)
      if done:
          observation = env.reset()
  env.close()
  ```
  This simple code demonstrates a basic RL environment where an agent learns to balance a pole on a cart, illustrating the trial-and-error process inherent in RL.
