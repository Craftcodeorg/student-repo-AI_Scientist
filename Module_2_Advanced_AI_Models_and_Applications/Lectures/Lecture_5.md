**Code Snippet**:  
```python
# Simplified example of using a neural network for drug discovery
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras import layers

# Define a simple model
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    layers.Dense(128, activation='relu', input_shape=(input_shape,)),
    layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'),
    layers.Dense(num_classes, activation='softmax')
])

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Train the model with hypothetical data
model.fit(train_data, train_labels, epochs=10)
```
