# Module Title: Advanced AI Models and Applications

## Exercise 5: Create a Predictive Model for Drug Discovery

---

### Problem Statement

In this exercise, you will apply the concepts learned in the lecture "AI Applications in Healthcare and Drug Discovery" to create a predictive model for drug discovery. Your task is to develop a neural network model using TensorFlow that can predict the efficacy of potential drug compounds based on a given dataset of molecular interactions. This exercise will require you to integrate your knowledge of AI algorithms and Quantum Machine Learning to optimize the model's performance.

#### Scenario:

Imagine you are part of a research team at a pharmaceutical company that is leveraging AI to accelerate the discovery of new drugs. You have been provided with a dataset containing molecular descriptors and their known efficacy outcomes. Your goal is to build a predictive model that can help identify promising drug candidates, thereby speeding up the drug discovery process.

### Fill-in-the-Blank Starter Code

Below is the starter code for your predictive model. You will need to fill in the blanks to complete the functionality. The comments will guide you through each step, ensuring you apply the techniques discussed in the lecture.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras import layers
import numpy as np

# Load your dataset
# Assume data is loaded into variables `features` and `labels`
features = np.array([...])  # Replace with actual data loading logic
labels = np.array([...])    # Replace with actual data loading logic

# Define the neural network model
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    layers.Dense(128, activation='relu', input_shape=(features.shape[1],)),
    layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'),
    layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')  # Output layer for binary classification
])

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', 
              loss='binary_crossentropy', 
              metrics=['accuracy'])

# Train the model with your dataset
model.fit(features, labels, epochs=10, batch_size=32)

# Evaluate the model performance
loss, accuracy = model.evaluate(features, labels)
print(f"Model accuracy: {accuracy:.2f}")

# Use Quantum Machine Learning techniques to enhance processing
# For demonstration purposes, this section will be theoretical
# Consider how quantum algorithms could optimize this step
```

### Hints

1. **Data Preparation**: Ensure your data is normalized before feeding it into the neural network. This can improve model convergence and accuracy.
   
2. **Model Architecture**: Consider adding dropout layers if you encounter overfitting during training. This technique helps in regularizing the model.
   
3. **Quantum Machine Learning**: Think about how quantum computing could be used to process large datasets more efficiently. While this exercise does not require implementation, understanding its potential applications can guide future research.

### Expected Outcome

By completing this exercise, you should be able to:

- Develop a predictive model using TensorFlow that can identify effective drug candidates.
- Demonstrate an understanding of how AI models can be applied to real-world drug discovery scenarios.
- Reflect on how Quantum Machine Learning could further enhance these processes in Academic Research and Development.

Your final solution should include error handling, such as checking for data integrity and ensuring all model parameters are correctly set. Make sure to comment on your code to explain each step and decision made during development.
