### Assignment: Creating a GAN to Generate Art from Text Descriptions ###

**Problem Statement:**
In this assignment, you will apply your understanding of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to create a model that generates art based on text descriptions. This task is particularly relevant in the field of Academic Research and Development, where such models can be used for creative AI applications, enhancing our understanding of neural networks' capabilities in artistic domains. Your goal is to develop a GAN that can interpret textual descriptions and produce corresponding visual art, thereby exploring the intersection of natural language processing and image synthesis.

**Starter Code:**
The following starter code sets up a basic framework for a GAN using TensorFlow. Your task is to expand upon this code to integrate a text-to-image generation pipeline.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras import layers
import numpy as np

# Generator model
def build_generator():
    model = tf.keras.Sequential([
        layers.Dense(256, activation='relu', input_dim=100),
        layers.Dense(512, activation='relu'),
        layers.Dense(1024, activation='relu'),
        layers.Dense(784, activation='sigmoid')
    ])
    return model

# Discriminator model
def build_discriminator():
    model = tf.keras.Sequential([
        layers.Dense(1024, activation='relu', input_shape=(784,)),
        layers.Dense(512, activation='relu'),
        layers.Dense(256, activation='relu'),
        layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
    ])
    return model

generator = build_generator()
discriminator = build_discriminator()

# Placeholder for additional code
# You will need to implement the training loop and integrate text input handling

# Example random noise input
noise = np.random.normal(0, 1, (1, 100))
generated_image = generator.predict(noise)

print("Generated Image Shape:", generated_image.shape)
```

**Detailed Instructions:**

1. **Integrate Text Processing:**
   - Implement a mechanism to convert text descriptions into a numerical format that can be used as input for the Generator. Consider using embeddings or other NLP techniques to handle text data.

2. **Modify the Generator:**
   - Update the generator model to accept both noise and processed text input. This may involve concatenating the text representation with the noise vector before feeding it into the neural network.

3. **Implement the Training Loop:**
   - Develop a training loop where the Generator and Discriminator are trained iteratively. Use the Discriminator's feedback to improve the Generator's output quality.
   - Ensure that the training process includes loss calculations and optimization steps for both networks.

4. **Evaluate and Visualize Results:**
   - Create a function to visualize generated images based on sample text inputs. This will help in assessing the quality and relevance of the generated art.
   - Implement evaluation metrics to gauge the GAN's performance, such as inception score or human evaluation.

**Criteria for Success and Evaluation:**

- **Functionality:**
  - The GAN should successfully generate images that correspond to given text descriptions.
  - The training loop should effectively update both Generator and Discriminator models.

- **Code Quality:**
  - The code should be clean, well-documented, and adhere to best practices in Python programming.
  - Use meaningful variable names and include comments explaining key steps in your code.

- **Output Quality:**
  - The generated images should show a clear relationship with the input text descriptions.
  - Visualizations should be clear and demonstrate the GAN's ability to produce diverse outputs.

- **Innovation:**
  - Bonus points for implementing advanced techniques or optimizations that enhance model performance or output quality.

This assignment aims to reinforce your understanding of GANs while providing hands-on experience in integrating text and image dataâ€”a crucial skill in AI research and development.
