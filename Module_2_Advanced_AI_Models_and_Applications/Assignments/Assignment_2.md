### Assignment: Enhance an NLP Model for Improved Language Translation

---

#### Problem Statement:

In this assignment, you will apply optimization techniques to enhance the performance of a neural network model used for language translation. You will focus on implementing adaptive optimization algorithms and regularization techniques to improve the model's accuracy and prevent overfitting. This task simulates a real-world scenario in academic research where improving model efficiency is crucial for developing state-of-the-art NLP applications.

#### Starter Code:

Below is the starter code for a simple neural network model using TensorFlow. Your task is to enhance this model by incorporating optimization techniques discussed in the lecture.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Embedding, LSTM, Dense
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential

# Starter code for language translation model
def create_translation_model(vocab_size, embedding_dim, lstm_units):
    model = Sequential([
        Embedding(input_dim=vocab_size, output_dim=embedding_dim),
        LSTM(units=lstm_units, return_sequences=True),
        Dense(vocab_size, activation='softmax')
    ])
    
    # Compile the model with a basic optimizer
    model.compile(optimizer='sgd', loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
    return model

# Define model parameters
vocab_size = 10000  # Example vocabulary size
embedding_dim = 256
lstm_units = 512

# Create the model
model = create_translation_model(vocab_size, embedding_dim, lstm_units)

# Print model summary
model.summary()
```

#### Detailed Instructions:

**Step 1: Implement Adaptive Optimization Algorithms**

- Modify the `create_translation_model` function to use the Adam optimizer instead of SGD. 
- Adjust the learning rate using an adaptive learning rate schedule such as RMSProp or AdaGrad.

**Step 2: Apply Regularization Techniques**

- Incorporate dropout layers after the LSTM layer to prevent overfitting. Experiment with dropout rates between 0.2 and 0.5.
- Add L2 regularization to the Dense layer to further enhance generalization.

**Step 3: Evaluate Model Performance**

- Train the model on a sample dataset (e.g., a subset of a language translation dataset).
- Evaluate the model's performance by comparing accuracy and loss before and after applying the optimization techniques.

**Step 4: Document Your Findings**

- Write a brief report summarizing the impact of the optimization techniques on the model's performance.
- Include visualizations of training/validation loss and accuracy over epochs to illustrate improvements.
